## Structure

Each topic folder contains:
- `README.md` — in-depth notes with theory, derivations, worked examples, and exam questions
- `Implementation.ipynb` — hands-on Python implementation (where applicable)
- `outputs/` — saved plots and figures
- `requirements.txt` — topic-specific dependencies
